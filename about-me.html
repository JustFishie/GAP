                <p>Hello! My name is Terrance, and I created GAP (Gifted Academy of Pi) for my Nueva application.</p>
                
                <p>I've always loved math. I was born on <strong>Pi Day (3/14)</strong>, and I like to think that math chose me! Numbers like π (pi), e, and φ amaze me because they go on forever without repeating. Out of all of them, π is my favorite. It's mysterious, important, and the first irrational number I ever learned about.</p>
                
                <p>I also love coding. My mom introduced me to an advanced AI programming tool called <strong>Cursor</strong>, which lets me create all kinds of complex things. So, I decided to combine my two favorite subjects—math and coding—to make a project that helps my friends learn about π and other math ideas through fun games.</p>
                
                <p>When I started, I thought the project would be easy. But I quickly realized it was more challenging than I expected. Along the way, I learned three important life skills:</p>
                
                <h2>Elaboration and Clarity</h2>
                <p>To work efficiently with others, including AI tools, I learned that clearly expressing my ideas is critical. Sometimes, the AI would misunderstand what I meant—like making the wrong half of a circle black—so I had to describe things very carefully. I tried different ways to "talk" to AI: sometimes I drew pictures, and other times I used more specific words to make my ideas clear.</p>
                
                <h2>Creating Problems Is Harder Than Solving Them</h2>
                <p>While working on GAP, I discovered that making a good problem or challenge is actually harder than solving one. When you create a problem, you have to think about how others will understand it, whether it's too easy or too hard, and how it connects to what they're learning. It taught me to think from other people's perspectives and make sure what I create helps others learn—not confuse them.</p>
                
                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                <p>This was the most time-consuming and sometimes frustrating part. Over time, I learned how to do it more efficiently with AI tools. I needed to clearly describe the issue and specify exactly when it happened. Sometimes, I even had to record a video to show the problem. For example, when my game's hint system lagged, I recorded the problem and shared it with Cursor so it could fix it. Then I tested it again to make sure the problem was completely solved.</p>
                
                <p>Through creating GAP, I didn't just build a game—I learned how to communicate better, think clearly, and solve problems.</p>
